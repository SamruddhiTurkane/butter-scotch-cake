Butterscotch is defined by the distinct brown sugar flavor that comes from molasses. This when caramelized gives a different flavor, aroma, and taste which is different from regular caramel.

Butterscotch has a distinct rich flavor that's hard to resist.  This simple and easy recipe makes the most decadent butterscotch cake with a moist texture and a soft crumb. Frosted with Swiss meringue buttercream and a butterscotch drip.

Cake layers - This a version of my light and fluffy vanilla cake with butter, whipped eggs, and butterscotch sauce in the recipe

The sauce - You can use store-bought butterscotch but homemade is so easy and takes less than 10 minutes to make. If you do decide to use my homemade recipe and video I recommend making it ahead so it has enough time to cool.

Frosting - Today, I am using a Swiss meringue buttercream (SMBC) but you can also use butterscotch buttercream.
Of course, there are other buttercreams that would work just as well. See my 50 plus buttercream frosting recipes on this blog.
